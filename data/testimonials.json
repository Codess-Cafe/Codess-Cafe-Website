        "description":"I was a part of the Codess.Cafe programme, which is an initiative by Aarnav Jindal to help and guide women in tech. The programme helped me a lot during my internship season and helped me bag an internship at Amazon. A big thank you to Aarnav for this amazing programme and for being a wonderful mentor! He guided and supported me, reviewed my resume, took my mock interview, and helped me realize my strengths and weaknesses. He would conduct weekly session to monitor the progress of the girls in this programme and that helped us to set weekly goals and targets. Codess.Cafe is a wonderful initiative by Aarnav Jindal for girls!!"

The idea is to throw away any inhibitions and doubts one has about herself, and look beyond what we've been told always by the society.
